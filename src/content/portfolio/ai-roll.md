details_title_1: 01. The Challenge
details_content_1: Payroll teams were drowning in employment contracts. Dozens of formats, edge cases, and long review cycles meant it could take months to process new agreements. Every contract had to be handled by hand, leaving plenty of room for mistakes and slowing down the whole operation.
details_title_2: 02. The Solution
details_content_2: We built a proof-of-concept system that could automatically read and parse contracts into a structured format. Instead of re-reading every page, staff could see the important details at a glance, validate quickly, and move on. The POC used safe, public sample data to prove the approach before touching any real files.

details_title_3: 03. The Result
details_content_3: "The POC showed strong potential: contract processing times could be cut by roughly two-thirds, with fewer errors and clearer audit trails. Even at this early stage, the team saw how much faster and more reliable their workflows could be once automated. Full rollout discussions are now on the table."
