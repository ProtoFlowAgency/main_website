details_title_1: 01. The Challenge
details_content_1: "Students on CyLynk’s platform were spending too much time searching for content and waiting on repetitive support responses. In a fast-moving subject like cybersecurity, this slowed learning and created extra workload for instructors."
details_title_2: 02. The Solution
details_content_2: "I built an AI-powered chatbot directly inside their LMS. It can answer student questions instantly, point learners to the right modules and labs, and support natural, conversational interactions. The system is lightweight, easy to maintain, and designed to scale as CyLynk adds new features."
blockquote: "Reliability was our top priority, the chatbot had to work inside the LMS every single time, no matter the load."
